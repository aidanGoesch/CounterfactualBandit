The game will start by showing you the pirates. First pick a pirate using the 1, 2, 3 button on your keyboard. When you are shown the ship with the item it was selling, try to remember the place you’re in by making up a story. You only have 3 seconds to pick a pirate, so please make a choice quickly! If you are too slow, you’ll have to wait a bit during the time out. Don’t feel rushed, but please do try to make a choice every time. </p><p>How good a pirate is at robbing a ship will change depending on the location they are in and how good the defenses are of the ship. This is just a practice game, so you’re not playing for money. You’ll receive a bag which may or may not contain gold coins. In the real game, though, you’ll be able to see whether or not you received the gold coins.
